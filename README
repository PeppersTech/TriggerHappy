Welcome! This bot helps moderate chat by detecting and flagging specific keywords.

Available Commands
!addword <word>
Adds a new word to the censor list. The bot will watch for this word in messages and reply when detected.
Example: !addword spoiler

!removeword <word>
Removes a word from the censor list. It will no longer trigger the bot.
Example: !removeword spoiler

!listwords
Shows the current list of censored keywords.

Permissions
Only users with the Manage Messages permission can use these commands.

How It Works
The bot caches the list of keywords on startup and updates the cache when words are added or removed.

When a message contains any of the censored keywords, the bot replies with a message including a random emoji and the censored word.
